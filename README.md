# whistle
A python program that teaches you how to whistle melodically. Currently a proof of concept and doesn't do much teaching yet, just displays the notes.

It uses PySoundCard by bastibe extensively to set up the stream- please see https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundCard
for set up instructions.

You will also need scipy and matplotlib. The rest of the dependencies should come with a standard python installation.
